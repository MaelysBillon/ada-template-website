# How is violence represented in different countries and languages?

* * *

Violence is a wide subject and its representation can be as diverse as one's imagination can go. Its degree of explicitness accepted by public is a line hard to draw for worldwide appreciation. Differents cultures have a different degree of tolerance toward such representation. When we say culture we, of course, mean public from different area of the world, but also from different era. Each person has a different backstory concerning violence, this backstory can come from History. Geopolitical events such as wars can influence the desire to see explicittype of violence.
